## lab4c_tcp.c
Source file for the program lab4c_tcp.
Works like the previous lab4b program except that it interacts with a server
over a tcp connection with the following mandatory arguments:
--id=9-digit-number
--host=name or address
--log=filename
port number
Connects to the server specified by the hostname and port number. It will receive
input which it should interact with in the same way lab4b interacted with stdin.
It will log all message it sends and receive the server to the logfile specified.
Furthermore, it will after it made a connection send a LOG message with the given id
as identification.

## lab4c_tls.c
Source file for the program lab4c_tls.
Works the same as with lab4c_tcp but has another security layer with ssl on top of the
communication over tcp. 

## compile.sh
Uses uname -a to see whether the environment is beaglebone or the linuxserver 
and compiles accordingly.

## Makefile
make / make default : will run the file compile.sh 
make dummy: compiles lab4c_tcp.c on linuxserver with -DUMMY option
make dummy2: compiles lab4c_tls.c on linuxserver with -DUMMY option
make tcp: compiles lab4c_tcp.c on beaglebone
make tls: compiles lab4c_tls.c on beaglebone
make clean: removes all files created by the Makefile
make dist: creates a tarball for submission
make check: runs the provided sanitycheck
make run: runs lab4c_tcp with given server
make run2: runs lab4c_tls with given server
make dummy: runs lab4c_tcp with given server with debug option
make dummy2: runs lab4c_tls with given server with debug option
