## lab0.c
Source code for the program lab0:
Copies from stdin to stdout
Given argument --input=infile it will instead read from infile
Given argument --output=outfile it will instead write to outfile
Given argument --segfault it will create a segmentation fault
Given argument --catch it will create activate its own segmentation fault handler when a segmentation fault occurs

## Usage 
./lab0 --input=filename --output=filename --segfault --catch

## Makefile
make / make all : will compile the source code lab0.c
make debug: compiles with -g flag for debugging with gdb
make clean: removes all files created by the Makefile
make dist: creates a tarball for submission
make check: runs a smoke-test. More explicitly runs smokeTest.sh

## smokeTest.sh
Runs most standard cases to check whether it works
Shell script that accessed basic copy without errors, handling wrong arguments, handling unable to access files fas input and /or output files and whether the segfault catch is done properly.

## backtrace.png
Ran with gdb debugger and took a screenshot of the backtrace after segmentation fault

## breakpoint.png
Ran with debugger and set a breakpoint right before segmentation fault and inspected the variable


There was not much to research or look at. Most of the code was referenced from the TAs discussion slide.
